# TANGO Project

This repository is a comprehensive collection of software that allows remote control of a robot movement and operation of all sensors on board. It provides a complete solution for controlling and monitoring the robotâ€™s behavior.
<br><br>
The project was completed by a team of 22 members.

## How it works
The Code is divided in three specific topic, each one managed by a different Arduino Mega:

## How we organize the development of the project

We split in different teams:
    
  - Application Team (Gionata - Francesco)
  - Documentation Team (Samuele Z. - Paola - Laura - Emir - Riccardo)
  - Communication Team (Samuele B.)
  - Sensors Team (Daniele - Davide)
  - Design Team (Gabriele - Florin - Michael)
  - Control/Emergency Team (Fabrizio - Gennaro - Loris - Federico)
  - Hardware Team (Lorenzo - Matteo - Edoardo - Diego - Andrea)
