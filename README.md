# TANGO Project

This repository is a comprehensive collection of software that enables remote control of a robot’s movement and operation of all the sensors on board. It provides a complete solution for controlling and monitoring the robot’s behavior.
<br><br>
The project was completed by a team of 12 members.

## How it works
The Code is splitted between tree specific topic, each one managed by a different Arduino mega, named specifically:
