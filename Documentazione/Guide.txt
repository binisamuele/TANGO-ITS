SoftwareSerial library has the following known limitations:

It cannot transmit and receive data at the same time.
If using multiple software serial ports, only one can receive data at a time.
Not all pins on the Mega and Mega 2560 boards support change interrupts, so only the following can be used for RX: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 50, 51, 52, 53, A8 (62), A9 (63), A10 (64), A11 (65), A12 (66), A13 (67), A14 (68), A15 (69). Not all pins on the Leonardo and Micro boards support change interrupts, so only the following can be used for RX: 8, 9, 10, 11, 14 (MISO), 15 (SCK), 16 (MOSI).
On Arduino or Genuino 101 boards the current maximum RX speed is 57600bps.
On Arduino or Genuino 101 boards RX doesn't work on digital pin 13.
If your project requires simultaneous data flows, see Paul Stoffregen's AltSoftSerial library.
