# Control Module

This sub repo contains the code that allows **Arduino MEGA** to send instruction to the two **H Bridges** connected to the engines. This Arduino Mega also check for an emergency to arise from  and stops the engines.

## Emergency
Arduino Mega receives an input to stop the engines from bumpers, buttons and ultrasonic sensors, as well as the other two Arduino. 

## Arduino Mega
Arduino Mega is connected with the others Arduino Mega to stop all operation in case of emergency.
